            <p style= "font-size: 25px;">The first Ultimate Frisbee game was played at Columbia High School when Joel Silver 
            pitched the idea to the students at the school in 1968. The next year a team was formed. The year after that, the first and second
            sets of rules were made for the players. College tournaments started in April of 1975. One other notable year for ultimate
            was 2001, when it was considered a medal sport in the world games in Japan. Today, more than 100,000 people play the sport and 
            it has it's own pro league called the AUDL.

                <ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman; font-size:25px;">
                    <li>A regulation field is 70 yards long by 40 yards wide, with end zones 20 yards deep</li>
                    <li>A regulation game has seven players per team</li>
                    <li>Each time the offense catches a pass in the defense's end zone, the offense scores a point</li>
                    <li>The disc may be advanced in any direction by completing a pass to a teammate. Players may not run with the disc</li>
                    <li>When a pass is not completed, the defense immediately takes possession of the disc and becomes the offense.</li>
                    <li>Players not in the game may replace players in the game after a score and during an injury timeout</li>
                    <li>Players must attempt to avoid physical contact during play</li>
                    <li>When a player initiates contact that affects the play, a foul occurs</li>
                    <li>Players are responsible for their own foul and line calls</li>
                    <li> The foundation of the rules in ultimate is Spirit of the Game</li>

                        Although these rules are simplified, these are the main ones everyone needs to know

            <p style= "font-size: 25px;">I sadly don't even know what made me get into frisbee, my friends from cross country invited me to play with
                them one day becasue they knew that I played. During our time playing, they recognized my skill, and they wanted me to join cross country 
                because we "would play ultimate a lot". After that i was hooked. I ran XC for two years and enjoyed the times we played. When i came to Fox,
                I knew I had to join the team here. I joined the frisbee team as one of only two freshman on the team, which meant a lot to me
                Eventually I honed my skills and became the player I am today. Ultimate is so great becasue everyone can play if they want to.
                And all skill levels are more than welcome. From the expert to the person who barely throws a frisbee around. All are welcome, 
                and almost everyone has a good time playing.
